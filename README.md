### New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium<a name = "dsge"></a>

The following is a reduced form of the New Keynesian Model. Output follows the process

$$
y_t = \rho y_{t-1} + (1 - \rho) \bar{y} - \frac{i_t - E_t \pi_{t+1} - r^n}{\theta} + \epsilon_t, \quad 0 < \rho < 1, \quad \theta, r_t^n > 0,
$$

where $\bar{y}$ denotes the full-employment level of output, $r^n$ is the natural real interest rate, and $\epsilon_t$ is a demand shock following an AR1 process given by

$$
\epsilon_t = \rho_\epsilon \epsilon_{t-1} + \epsilon_t^\epsilon, \quad \epsilon_t^\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2), \quad 0 < \rho_\epsilon < 1.
$$

Inflation follows the mechanism

$$
\pi_t = \beta E_t \pi_{t+1} + \omega \left( y_t - \bar{y} \right) + \zeta_t, \quad 0 < \beta < 1, \omega > 0,
$$

where $\zeta_t$ is an inflation shock following an AR1 process given by

$$
\zeta_t = \rho_\zeta \zeta_{t-1} + \epsilon_t^\zeta, \quad \epsilon_t^\zeta \sim N(0, \sigma_\zeta^2), \quad 0 < \rho_\zeta < 1.
$$

Expectations are formed in an adaptive (backward-looking) manner according to

$$
E_t \pi_{t+1} = \lambda \pi^* + (1 - \lambda) \pi_t, \quad 0 < \lambda < 1.
$$

where $\lambda$ denotes the extent of the credibility of the monetary authority and $\pi^*$ is the inflation target. The monetary authority follows the Taylor rule

$$
i_t = r^n + \pi_t + \chi_\pi (\pi_t - \pi^*) + \chi_y (y_t - \bar{y}), \quad \chi_\pi, \chi_y > 0.
$$

The overall loss function in the economy, $L$, is measured by the following function

$$
L = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \delta^t \left((y_t - \bar{y})^2 + \mu (\pi_t - \pi^*)^2 \right), \quad 0 < \delta < 1, \mu > 0.
$$

First we use initial conditions simulate output, inflation, and the interest rate policy for 1000 periods. We will set $\rho = 0.8$, $\bar{y} = 1$, $\theta = 2$, $r^n = 0.04$, $\beta = 0.95$, $\delta = 0.95$, $\rho_\epsilon = \rho_\zeta = 0.9$, $\sigma_\epsilon^2 = \sigma_\zeta^2 = 0.001$, $\omega = 0.5$, $\mu = 0.2$, $\lambda = 0.5$, $\pi^* = 0.02$, and $\chi_\pi = \chi_y = 0.5$. We will assume that the initial conditions are given by $y_0 = 0.95$, $\pi_0 = 0.02$, and $\epsilon_0 = \zeta_0 = 0$. 

Then we will look at an economy where the monetary authority does not have any credibility, i.e. $\lambda = 0$, and for an economy where the monetary authority has full credibility, i.e. $\lambda = 1$. We will see the overall loss for 1000 periods using the given loss function.

Finally we will look at an economy where the monetary authority is very dovish and does not care about inflation at all, i.e. $\chi_\pi = 0$, and for an economy where the monetary authority is very hawkish and cares strongly about inflation, for instance $\chi_\pi = 2$. We will, again, see the overall loss for 1000 periods using the given loss function.

| Metric                            | Value      |
|-----------------------------------|------------|
| **Average output**                | 0.94548    |
| **Average inflation**             | 0.020037   |
| **Standard deviation of output**  | 0.033016   |
| **Standard deviation of inflation** | 0.026745   |

| **Lambda Value** | **Total Loss** |
|-----------------|---------------|
| 0               | 0.059242      |
| 1               | 0.028441      |

| **$x_{\pi}$ Value**  | **Total Loss** |
|----------------|---------------|
| 0              | 0.014786      |
| 2              | 0.032218      |

As expected we see a greater loss in the situations where the monetary authority does not have any credibility and also where they are very hawkish. This makes sense as when the monetary authority does not have any credibility households and firms will deviate from the inflation target and increase volatility in output. Furthermore, a hawkish monetary authority would interfere more with the inflation of the economy thus increasing the loss of the output function.

### Contraction Mapping<a name = "map"></a>


We can use MATLAB to find roots of higher order equations using a contraction mapping approach. This is especially useful in dynamic programming as it allows us to solve value functions that can be used to model economic growth. For example, consider the cubic equation, $g(x) = x^3 + x^2 - ax + 1 = 0$, $x \in A$, $A = R[0, 1]$. We define the operator

$$
x_{n+1} = \Gamma(x_n) = \frac{1}{a} \left[ x_n^3 + x_n^2 + 1 \right].
$$

The code in __________ solves this.

### Stochastic Real Business Cycle<a name = "rbcs"></a>

We can also consider the following RBC model where the Social Plannerâ€™s problem is given by

$$E_{t=0} \left[ \max_{\{{c_t, l_t}\}^\infty} \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t U(c_t, l_t) \right]$$

subject to:

$$
0 \leq c_t \leq e^{z_t} f(k_t, n_t) - k_{t+1} + (1 - \delta) k_t,
$$
$$
l_t + n_t \leq 1, \quad c_t, l_t, n_t \geq 0, \quad k_0 \text{ is given}, \quad 1 > \beta, \delta > 0.
$$

Let $f(k_t, n_t) = k_t^\alpha n_t^{1-\alpha}$, and $U(c_t, l_t) = \theta \ln(c_t) + (1-\theta) \ln(l_t)$, where $0 \leq \alpha, \theta \leq 1$. We can assume that $z_t$ follows a first-order symmetric Markov process where $z_t \in \{z_l, z_h\}$ with $z_l = 1 - z$, and $z_h = 1 + z$, $1 > z > 0$. The Markov transition probabilities are given by

$$
\Pi(z' | z) = \begin{bmatrix}
\pi_{ll} & \pi_{lh} \\
\pi_{hl} & \pi_{hh}
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\phi & 1 - \phi \\
1 - \phi & \phi
\end{bmatrix},
\text{ where } 0 < \phi < 1$.
$$

We can use MATLAB to calibrate the economy based on parameters from literature and also numarically solve the model economy using Discrete State Space Value Function Iteration Method.

![Capital](https://github.com/oruc47/matlab_macro_economic_sim/blob/2726c3313db1537f14077c2e414047d6131e8be7/images/capital.png)

### Deterministic Real Business Cycle <a name = "rbc"></a>

Consider an economy where a large number of identical households seek to maximize their discounted lifetime utility given by

$$
\max_{{c_t}^\infty} \sum_{t = 0}^{\infty} \beta^t \ln(c_t)
$$

such that

$$
c_t + a_{t+1} \leq w_t n_t^s + a_t(1 + r_t),
$$

$$
c_t, a_t \geq 0, \quad 0 \leq n_t^s \leq 1, \quad a_0 > 0
$$

$c_t$ and $n_t^s$ are consumption and labor supply of the household at time $t$. Households have one unit of time available that can be used for leisure and work. Wage rate $w_t$ and interest rate $r_t$ (net of depreciation) are competitively settled. Firms maximize their profits by picking optimal $k_t$ and $n_t^d$, where

$$
\Pi_t = \max_{k_t, n_t^d} \left( f(k_t, n_t^d) - w_t n_t^d - (r_t + \delta) k_t \right),
$$

Production technology is given by $f(k_t, n_t) = k_t^\alpha n_t^{1-\alpha}$.

Capital depreciates at rate $0 < \delta < 1$. 

We can rewrite this model using the social planner's problem and using Value Function Iteration we will be able to numerically find the value and policy functions. 

The nice thing about simulating this optimization over code is that we can see what happens when we stimulate other exogenous factors. For example, in the case where there is a earthquake that destorys 20% of the economy. 

We can see the result of the simulation graphically:
